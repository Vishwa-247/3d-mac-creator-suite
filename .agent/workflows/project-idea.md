STUDYMATE — FINAL 
UPDATED PROJECT PLAN
(Agentic, Production-Thinking Career Platform)
This is not a course platform.
This is not a mock interview app.
This is a thinking simulator for real-world engineering & interviews.

CORE PROBLEM (WHY THIS EXISTS)
Reality
Colleges teach theory
Platforms teach content
Interviews test decision-making under constraints
Students fail because they:
Jump to solutions
Ignore scale, cost, failure
Donʼt think like real engineers
Your Solution
Build a system that behaves like a real senior engineer / interviewer / team, and 
forces the user to think before answering.
󾠯
CORE IDEA (ONE-LINE)
An agentic career platform that trains users to think in production by 
questioning, challenging, and adapting to their decisions.

MODULES (FINAL & LOCKED)
You have 6 core modules.
🧠
MODULE 1: AGENT ORCHESTRATOR 
(THE BRAIN)
What it does
Stores user goal (role, focus)
Tracks weaknesses across system
Decides what user should do next
Example
2
🔥
 STUDYMATE  FINAL UPDATED PROJECT PLAN
If user:
Fails interview trade-offs → push Interview Thinking
Struggles with recursion → push DSA Visualizer
Finishes learning fast → skip basics
User does NOT control the flow blindly. System guides them.
🎓
MODULE 2: INTERACTIVE COURSE 
GENERATION (UNIQUE)
Old Way 
❌
Generate 10 chapters
User reads passively
New Way 
✅
Course behaves like a mentor
How ONE lesson works (REAL EXAMPLE)
Topic: Load Balancing
Step 1 — Scenario First
“Your backend receives 10x traffic suddenly. What breaks first?ˮ
Options:
Database
Load Balancer
Application Server
Cache
3
🔥
 STUDYMATE  FINAL UPDATED PROJECT PLAN
User chooses: Database
Step 2 — Why Question
“Why do you think database breaks first?ˮ
User explains.
Step 3 — Teaching (Contextual)
System explains:
When DB becomes bottleneck
When app or LB breaks instead
Why naive assumptions fail
Step 4 — Failure Injection
“Now traffic spikes unevenly. What changes?ˮ
User adapts.
Step 5 — Micro Check
One small check → result affects next lesson.
Why this is unique
No content dump
Question → decision → explanation
Branching based on thinking quality
🧪
MODULE 3: PROJECT STUDIO (MOST 
UNIQUE PART)
4
🔥
 STUDYMATE  FINAL UPDATED PROJECT PLAN
Problem
Students donʼt know:
What project to pick
How real projects are designed
Solution
Simulate a real software company workflow using agents.
REAL EXAMPLE: PROJECT STUDIO FLOW
User says:
“I want to build a resume-worthy backend project.ˮ
Agent 1: Idea Analyst
Asks:
Who is the user?
What problem?
Why this project matters?
Rejects weak ideas.
Agent 2: Research Agent
Says:
Similar products exist
What works / what fails
Scope trimming
Agent 3: System Design Agent
Designs:
5
🔥
 STUDYMATE  FINAL UPDATED PROJECT PLAN
Architecture
APIs
DB schema (high-level)
Explains trade-offs
Agent 4: UI/UX Agent
Defines:
Screens
User flow
UX logic
Agent 5: Execution Planner
Creates:
Week-wise milestones
What to build first
What can wait
Agents may disagree — this is realism.
💼
MODULE 4: PRODUCTION THINKING 
INTERVIEW MODULE
This is NOT mock Q&A.
This is a real interviewer simulation.
REAL INTERVIEW EXAMPLE
Question
6
🔥
 STUDYMATE  FINAL UPDATED PROJECT PLAN
“You have 5000 resumes. Pick top 20.ˮ
Step 1 — Clarification
System asks:
“Are resumes PDFs? One-time or continuous? Bias constraints?ˮ
If user jumps to solution → penalty.
Step 2 — Core Answer
User explains approach.
Step 3 — Follow-up (KEY DIFFERENCE)
System asks:
“What fails at scale?ˮ
“How do you monitor this?ˮ
“How do you handle bias complaints?ˮ
Step 4 — Curveball
“Now resumes double overnight.ˮ
User must adapt.
Step 5 — Reflection
“What would you improve with more time?ˮ
Interview Metrics (NOT right/wrong)
Metric
Meaning
Clarification Habit
Do they ask questions first
7
🔥
 STUDYMATE  FINAL UPDATED PROJECT PLAN
Metric
Meaning
Structure
Clear thinking
Trade-off Awareness Pros/cons
Scalability Thinking
Failure Awareness
Adaptability
Beyond small scale
What breaks
Adjust after feedback
Feedback is pattern-based, not generic.
🧩
MODULE 5: DSA SKILL MASTERY (WITH 
VISUALIZER)
Core Insight (YOUR POINT)
Understanding code ≠ understanding algorithm.
DSA VISUALIZER FLOW (REAL EXAMPLE)
Algorithm: Binary Search
Step 1 — Visual Run
User sees:
Pointer movement
Mid updates
Comparisons
Step 2 — Pause & Predict
“What happens next?ˮ
User answers.
8
🔥
 STUDYMATE  FINAL UPDATED PROJECT PLAN
Step 3 — Explanation
System explains step.
Step 4 — Pattern Mapping
Links:
Binary search → lower bound problems
Similar patterns
No compiler needed.
Visualizer + reasoning is enough.
📊
MODULE 6: CAREER TRACKER 
(INTELLIGENCE)
What it shows
Learning growth
Interview thinking improvement
DSA mastery
Weak areas
What it does NOT do
❌
 Predict job in X days
Trends > fake predictions.
󾠲
WHAT WE REMOVED (FINAL)
❌
 Judge0 / Code execution
❌
 Docker sandbox
❌
 Live WebRTC
❌
 Mobile app

WHY THIS PROJECT IS STRONG (FINAL VERDICT)
This project:
Teaches how to think, not what to memorize
Simulates real interviews & teams
Is agentic (decision + memory + adaptation)
Is unique in the market
Is defendable for a 12-credit final year project
󾠴
FINAL ONE-PARAGRAPH DESCRIPTION (USE THIS)
StudyMate is an agentic career preparation platform that simulates real-world 
engineering thinking by questioning users, challenging assumptions, and 
adapting learning paths based on their decisions. Unlike traditional platforms 
that focus on static content or mock interviews, StudyMate emphasizes 
production-grade reasoning through interactive courses, multi-agent project 
design simulations, production-style interview scenarios, and algorithm 
visualizations. The system continuously evaluates user thinking patterns and 
guides them toward industry-ready decision-making skills.
